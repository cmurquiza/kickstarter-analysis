# Kickstarting with Excel

## Overview of Project: A data analysis of crowdfunding data.

### Purpose: This data analysis was to organize, sort and analyze data to help Louis have the information necessary to crowdfund her campaign to optimal success. 

## Analysis and Challenges: A lot of the analysis was based on different category outcomes, different geographical locations, and launch dates. Some of the challenges were to figure out what caategory succeeded the most, where it succeeded the most, and around what time of year did it succeed the most in.

### Analysis of Outcomes Based on Launch Date: The outcomes based on launch date findings showed that theater campaigns launched around May succeeded significantly better than launched during any other month of the year. October and December were months where a launch should be avoided since success rate was significantly lower, and failed rates actually increased.

### Analysis of Outcomes Based on Goals: The analysis outcomes based on goals, was an analysis on musical outcomes in Great Britian in regards to goals and pledges outcomes. It was found that the average campaign goal for a play in Great Britian was over $4,000. The average pledged amounts was about $1047. It would be wise to try to produce a play for less than $2,000 since that is less than even the 3rd quartile of amounts pledged. 

### Challenges and Difficulties Encountered: Some of the difficulties encountered was making sure the filters were distributed and placed properly in the pivot tables to make sure we were producing the correct story we were trying to tell. Also, making sure we were asking the right questions so we can get the right answers that would best benefit Louis in her playwright campaign journey.

## Results

- What are two conclusions you can draw about the Outcomes based on Launch Date?
    Two conculsions you can draw about the outcomes based on launch dates are to launch a campaign in May which had the highest rate of success for theaters, and to refrain from launching a campaign in October or December which had a drastic decrease in successful theater launches and increases in failed launches. 

- What can you conclude about the Outcomes based on Goals? It would be best to produce a play for less than $2,000 since the average and 3rd quartile for the pledged outcomes were less than $2,000.

- What are some limitations of this dataset? Some limtiations in this data set is the amount of data that was collected and how many times it was collected could be a factor in why if any of this information was not the case, it could not be showing the true story since we haven't collected enough data or not as many times to test.

- What are some other possible tables and/or graphs that we could create? Other tabes and graphs that could be made are testing to see which plays/theaters based on genre were more successful or not, and seeing which genre seems to be the most popular, and testing that by geographical location to see the difference between the US and other countries and genre.
